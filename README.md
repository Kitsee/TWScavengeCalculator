## Installation As a User Script
Many browsers support user scripts directly, such browsers will usally offer to install a user script when the script is viewed in browser.
The script can be accessed directly via this address:

Google Chrome in particular does support user scripts (which they call extensions) however it only allows scripts that are available on
the Google web store to be enabled. A workaround for this is to use a user script runner extension such as [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).
With TamperMonkey installed, chrome will offer to install a script when viewed via this link:

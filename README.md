Google Chrome in particular does support user scripts (which they call extensions) however it only allows scripts that are available on
the Google web store to be enabled. A workaround for this is to use a user script runner extension such as [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).
With TamperMonkey install, chrome will offer to install a script when viewed via this link:
